# Api Interaction Code Samples

Here you can find some code snippets for Python and Java on how to set up your code to pull data from an API
using headers and auth tokens.

If you have any questions about this reach out to me or one of the mentors at the hackathon.

Please note that the authorization token does not work but to showcase where one would go when building your API call.
